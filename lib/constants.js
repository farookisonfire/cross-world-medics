Hospital and Clinical schedules do change depending on physician availability and demand, so it is possible that your schedule may change slightly or that you may shadow more than one physician. Cross World Medics puts in the added effort to try and match you to the rotation of your choice; however, we do not guarantee specific specialty placements.'
